# Thunderbolt

This is a simple IOT device to monitor the state of a Trimble Thunderbolt GPS Disciplined Oscillator.

People have made interesting UIs for the Thunderbolt.  This project is not that.  The goal here is to have a very simple UI using Go/No-Go LED, as well as a simple Web UI that shows the basic status of the device.
